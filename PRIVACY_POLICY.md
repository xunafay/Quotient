## No Data Collection

Quotient does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or information. All data is stored locally on the userâ€™s device and can be deleted at the user's discretion. Quotient is fully functional without an internet connection, and no data is ever sent to the developers or third parties.

## Permissions Required

Quotient requires access to read and write external storage to allow users to create backups and restore their data. Users have full control over these backups and the app will only access files related to Quotient's functionality.

### Biometric

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.USE_BIOMETRIC" />
```

The biometric permission is used to provide users with the option to secure their Quotient app with fingerprint authentication or other biometric data available on the device. This feature is optional and provided for added security.
