# Architecture

This document outlines the architecture for a Flutter app that utilizes the BLoC pattern and Hive for local data persistence.

## Overview

The architecture follows a layered approach, separating concerns into different layers:

- Presentation Layer: Contains the UI components and handles user interactions.
- Business Logic Layer: Implements the BLoC pattern to manage the app's state and business logic.
- Data Layer: Handles data persistence using Hive.

## Presentation Layer

The presentation layer consists of the following components:

- Pages: Represent the different screens of the app.
- Widgets: Represent the different UI components of the app.

## Business Logic Layer

The business logic layer implements the BLoC pattern to manage the app's state and business logic. It consists of the following components:

- Bloc: Manage the app's state and business logic.
- Cubits: Manage the app's state.

## Data Layer

The data layer handles data persistence using Hive, a lightweight and fast NoSQL database for Flutter. It consists of the following components:

- Models: Represent the data structures used by the app.
- Repositories: Provide an abstraction layer for data operations, such as CRUD operations.
- Providers: Provide an abstraction layer for data sources, such as local and remote data sources.
